## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Tiktok:
- Many videos are available to watch
- Can repost any entertaining videos we like

Instagram:
- Can easily contact family/friends
- Able to delete messages and block people

Capcut:
- Easy way to make/edit videos with numerous features

An app that I would like to implement is a career chooser. It could give the user a quiz and ask uesions about what the person likes and things they have previously done. at the end of this they would get career choices that are best fit for them and resources to learn about that career.
